        Hi, my name is Sam and welcome to my own personal website! A few things
        to know about me are that I was born and raised in a small town outside
        Boston called Topsfield and I like to play soccer, ultimate disc, and
        ski. I have one older brother who is two years older than me and just
        graduted from Clarkson University. Also, I have a cat name Peyton and
        don't worry she actually really enjoys being held like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to come to
        <a href="https://www.babson.edu/" target="_blank">Babson College</a>
        because it is an entreprenuership school and my brain is constantly
        coming up with new ideas which I may want to pursue in the future. I
        also wanted to go somewhere that is a driving distance from my house and
        had small class sizes. For all of these reasons and many more, Babson
        seemed to be in the sweet spot for everything I was looking for in a
        school.

        My favortie hobby is <strong>skiing</strong> and I have been
        participating in this activity ever since I was &lt;3 years old. Over
        the past 18 years, I have gained an extensive amount of knowledge and
        expirience on and off the slopes. As a freshman in high school, I began
        instructing new skiers and continued this for 3 years at both
        <a href="https://www.mountsunapee.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Sunapee</a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/" target="_blank">Sunday River</a>.
        Currently, I am employed at
        <a href="https://bostonskiandtennis.com/" target="_blank"
          >Boston Ski and Tennis</a
        >, a small ski shop located in Newton, MA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The type of skiing I like to do is skiing mostly off-piste, though as a
        <!-- The new attribute I learned here was em whcih emphasizes the text that you put inside. I learned this on W3Schools.com -->
        New England resident I <em>rarely</em> get the chance. One of my
        favorite videos that shows off-piste skiing is
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygxufRprWpY" target="_blank"
          >Just one of those Days</a
        >
        by Candide Thovex. I love this video because he shows what peak skiing
        ability looks like.
