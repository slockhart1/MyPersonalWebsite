        <h1>Sunday River Ski Resort</h1>
        <p>
          Sunday River is one of New England's largest ski resorts, spanning 3
          miles between its 8 interconnected peaks. This allows Sunday River to
          have a total trail acreage of 884 and 139 trails and glades that can
          be skied. The terrain featured in this resort lends well to any skier
          type, whether you are a beginner or an expert. <br /><br />
          In New England, having so much area to cover can be challenging for
          ski resorts especially when it comes to the variability of conditions
          in the east. Sunday River does an incredible job at solving this
          problem with their award winning snowmaking team, who will ensure that
          there is ample skiable terrain year round. <br /><br />In addition to
          investing heavily in snowmaking, Sunday River has been working on
          updating their lifts to allow more skiers to expirience the awesome
          terrain that they offer. Currently, the resort has 18 lifts (5 high
          speed lifts) that can service up to 32,900 skiers per hour.
          <br /><br />
          If you are looking to take your next vacation here, there are tons of
          opportunities to find lodging. Sunday River has a 6,000 person
          capacity for on-mountain lodging as well as a 2,000 person capacity
          for off-mountain lodging, with options ranging in price depending on
          location and amenities. As someone who has skied here before, I would
          always recommend finding a place to stay thats ski-on-ski-off so you
          can worry less about travel and more about skiing this wonderful
          resort. The resort also offers many activites beyond skiing such as
          tubing and skating, as well as bars, bowling alleys, and movie
          theaters in the area. If you are looking for a great place to take
          your family this winter, Sunday River is the place for you.
