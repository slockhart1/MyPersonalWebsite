    <h1>Apres.com</h1>

    <p>My website will be a place for the ski community to find bars, restaurants, and events happenning after the ski day is over. The website will feature a description of each mountain, including a map of the places to go in the area. Users will be able to click on the map to find more information, similar to maps on google.  </p>
    <p>The objective of my website is to increase the ease of finding events and good spots around unfamiliar mountain locations. Many people who visit ski areas are unfamiliar with the surrounding town, Apres.com will be the one-stop website where they can find all information.</p>
    <p>My target audience for this website is skiers and snowboarders ages 21-30. The reason they must be 21+ is because most places displayed on Apres.com will be bars in the area of the ski resort.</p>
    <p>I plan on focusing on a single ski resort and 3 locations around it. I feel like this will keep things easy and allow me to work on coding the map and stylizing the pages. I plan on doing a main page on Sunday River and including information on The Matterhorn Ski Bar, The Foggy Goggle, and The Shipyard.</p>
